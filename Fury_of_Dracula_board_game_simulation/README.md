# Project Introduction
This assignment is a simplified version of the game 'The Fury of Dracula'. The game involves the arch-vampire Dracula, four intrepid vampire hunters and the splendid cities of Victorian Europe. The aim for Dracula is to evade the hunters for long enough to realise his Grand Plan - to release hordes of vampires all over Europe, while the aim for the hunters is to kill Dracula before he can do so.


# How the game works
Dracula and the hunters move around the cities and seas of Europe. Every time a hunter moves into the same city as Dracula and survives his traps, they have an encounter and Dracula loses some blood.

Dracula knows where the hunters are, but the hunters do not know where Dracula is. But he does leave clues… for if a hunter enters a city where Dracula has been in any of the last 6 rounds, the hunter discovers traces of his passing and can deduce precisely when he was there. For this reason, Dracula’s last 6 moves are called his trail.

The hunters work as a team, spreading out and hunting for Dracula. At the start of the game they have a score of 366 points, and for each round that passes the score slowly diminishes. The hunters need to kill Dracula before their score is reduced to an embarrassingly small number.
