### 2.3. Task 3 - Responsive static page

Build a responsive page that complies with `task3/page_big.PNG` and `task3/page_small.png`. The big page is 1197 x 1610 
pixels, and the small page is 453 x 1873 pixels. Your single page (note that you're not using two separate HTML files) should like identical to either of these pages depending on the window sized the browser is at.

Your are expected to have reasonable intermediate states. In other words, if the window size is some combination of widths between 1197 and 453, combined with some combination of heights between 1610 and 1873, the page should still reflect the same general structure.

Please build your page in `task3/index.html`. You are welcome to create as many CSS files that you need in the `task3` folder for `index.html` to import. When being marked, your tutor will start with `index.html`.

On top of this you are required to:
 * When the "Sign up" button is hovered over, it's opacity must change from `1` to `0.5`
 * When the "Learn More" button is hovered over, it's background changes to `#ffffff` and and color to `#000000`

#### Assets
* The asset(s) are provided in `task3/assets`.
* Your font doesn't have to match exactly. You can use font-family `Arial` for the page.
